Secure Messaging
Step 1: Create a New Replit Project
Go to Replit and log in or sign up.

Click the "Create Repl" button (usually a + icon).

In the template selection, choose "Flask".

Give your Repl a name (e.g., secure-messaging-app).

Click "Create Repl".

Step 2: Update main.py (or app.py) with your Flask Code
Replit's Flask template usually creates a main.py or app.py file. You will replace its content with your secure_messaging_app.py code.

In the file explorer on the left, click on main.py (or app.py).

Delete all existing code in this file.

Copy the entire content of your secure_messaging_app.py (the Python code I provided previously, including all imports, classes, functions, and routes).

Paste it into main.py.

Important Note for Replit: Replit typically runs main.py. Ensure your if __name__ == '__main__': block uses app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080) to make it accessible from Replit's web view. Your current code uses app.run(debug=True), which is fine for development, but Replit will handle the host/port for you.

Step 3: Create the templates Directory and HTML Files
Your Flask application uses Jinja2 templates, which need to be in a specific directory.

In the Replit file explorer, click the "Add file" button (or "New File" icon).

Type templates/ and press Enter. This will create a new directory named templates.

Now, inside the templates directory, create your HTML files:

Click on the templates directory in the file explorer.

Click "Add file" again.

Type index.html and press Enter.

Copy the content of the index.html immersive artifact I provided and paste it into this new index.html file.

Repeat the process for login.html and register.html:

Create templates/login.html and paste its content.

Create templates/register.html and paste its content.

Step 4: Install Dependencies
Your application requires Flask and cryptography. Replit usually handles Flask automatically for the Flask template, but you'll need to explicitly add cryptography.

In the Replit sidebar, click on the "Packages" icon (looks like a cube or puzzle piece).

In the search bar, type cryptography and press Enter.

Click the "Install" button next to cryptography.

Alternatively, you can open the Shell tab at the bottom of the Replit interface and run:

pip install cryptography

Step 5: Run Your Application
Click the large green "Run" button at the top of the Replit interface.

Replit will start your Flask application. A web view will appear on the right side of the screen, showing your application.

Step 6: Test Your Application
Register: On the initial login page, click "Register here". Create a new username and password.

Login: After successful registration, you'll be redirected to the login page. Log in with your new credentials.

Send Messages: Once logged in, you can type messages, select a cipher (Fernet or XOR), and send them.

View Messages: Your sent messages (and any others stored) will appear decrypted on the main page.

Logout: Test the logout functionality.

You now have a fully functional secure messaging application running on Replit!
